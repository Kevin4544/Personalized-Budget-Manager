# Personalized-Budget-Manager

Many people struggle to track expenses and maintain consistent savings habits. A personalized budget manager lets you log expenses, set savings goals, and categorize spending in one place. The system produces simple reports or visual summaries to show spending patterns and support better financial discipline.

This Python application stores your expenses, saving goals, and spending categories in a structured format. You enter a transaction though a console or simple GUI, and the program processes the data to calculate totals and trends. It generates basic reports or charts using Matplotlib to show where money goes and how spending aligns with goals.
